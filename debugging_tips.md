* Put a .catch on axios calls (or any promise)
* Read and analyze error message
* console.log()
* Look at syntax
* Look back on old code
* Spellcheck
    * Don't leave it to spelling errors if possible. Use constants to take advantage of VSCode's built-in autocomplete and cause easy errors (e.g. Redux action types)
* Use devtools in chrome (for redux, react, etc.)
* Try breaking it harder
    *Make sure it's actually breaking where you think it is
* Ask someone for help
* Google the error message
* Ask for help online (stack overflow, etc.)
